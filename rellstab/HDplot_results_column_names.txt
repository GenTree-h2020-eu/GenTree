SNP.missing = SNP ID, composed of contig and pos
MISS_IND = no. of missing individuals
contig = contig name
pos = position within the contig
depth_a	= read count of reference allele in heterozygous individuals
depth_b = read count of alternative allele in heterozygous individuals
RAF	= reference allele frequency in heterozygous individuals
num_hets = no. of heterozygotes
num_samples	= total no. of samples
total_depth	= total depth in heterozygous individuals
depth_per_het = average depth per heterozygous individual
hetPerc	= proportion of heterozygous individuals, ignoring missing data (wrong, don't use it!)
std	= standard deviation (of depth_per_het???)
D = deviation from (usual) read-ratio (1:1) (=z-score)
H = correct proportion of heterozygous individuals, accounting for missing data
AB = allele balance (=higher allele read count/lower allele read count)
